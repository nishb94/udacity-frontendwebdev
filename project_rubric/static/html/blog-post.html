                    <p>Not every day, I wake up with happy feelings..excited for the day (I wish though!!!) Some days, I go to bed again if I don’t feel good after waking up 👀 For me, I come first. My mental health is always my 🔝 priority I believe..if I’m taking care of myself, I can take care of everything else. For that, keeping myself motivated is a big task.But.. I love over-thinking and over-analyzing situations. I have the power to think about the worst possible thing that could happen 😕 Occasional meltdowns. Embarrassing moments. CRYing 😿 In last 3 years, I’ve had many instances where I lost my cool. And you know what - its okay!</p>

                        It’s okay to cry. It helps clean your eyes and removes dirty water from your body. - my Dad

                    <p>1. Take ① day at a time 😌</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, things aren’t easy, and you might feel like nothing is working; nothing is going right or as planned. When I was moving places in May, I was very much overwhelmed with everything going on in life. I knew San Francisco 🌉 is where I want to be but made no plans. I panicked 😨 when I got the job and realized I’d have to move in 2 weeks. Stepping outside comfort zone 😵 The best advice I got from my mentor was to take a deep breath 😌 and take 1 day at a time. Every day I woke up and planned for that exact day. That helped me for the next 3 months until I felt comfortable again 💫</p>
